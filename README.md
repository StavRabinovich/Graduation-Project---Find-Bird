# Graduation-Project - FindBird

Together with [Lior Mitrany](https://github.com/mitrlior/)

The primary purpose of FindBird is to enable both amateur and expert birdwatchers to identify and learn about birds using a smartphone application. Furthermore, new bird locations (from recognitions) will be kept, allowing birdwatchers to discover which birds are in their region. In this approach, bird recognition will be available to all interested parties, allowing them to learn more about bird locations and track them.
